#JavaScript Individual Challenge#


##1. Process for learning a new language##

1. Initially wrote a two column table where one column represented ruby code and the other represented JavaScript. I wrote exemplar code for function, conditions, string interpolation, iterating through arrays, classes.
I began to see significant differences in the both languages especially when it came to classes, but I did not have a full understanding. Click link [Ruby vs JavaScript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0abj4ZjjoAY0YZJ4MKKGhDdDgYQeIG8BAg8o-vO9qY/edit)

2. Decided to read through W3 Schools JavaScript online tutorials on functions, classes, variables, constants to get further insight, but felt that there were still gaps in my knowledge.

3. I went on to do the Codecademy JavaScript course, but I had a limited amount of time to complete the full course as I had to incorporate attending workshops and pairing in the afternoon to complete the thermostat challenge. I managed to cover: conditionals, functions, then I was going to skip some tutorials to go on to classes unfortunately I realised that I had to focus on the thermostat challenge more so that I would at least get to the stage where I would exposure to JQuery, and api's.

4. I followed the thermostat challenge but relied heavily on the walkthrough. I managed to get as far as using jquery to display the temperature on the index.html browser. Click the link [thermostat](https://github.com/SimoneW2/thermostat).

5. Attended workshops.

6. Googled exemplar code snippets and read through pills to gain more understanding of JavaScript.



##2. Test-drive some JavaScript objects##

##Take Away Challenge##
###My Approach###
My first attempt at completing both the Airport Challenge and the Take Away challenge  were limited. I decided to use an exemplar of the Take Away challenge written in Ruby and then to convert it into JavaScript.
I used the ![take-away challenge exemplar](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-exemplar)

###Take Away Challenge - User Story###
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order
